## Solution

That means there are two sites in this challenge. The current site, and the site at http://natas21-experimenter.natas.labs.overthewire.org. Let's start with the sourcecode of the current site:

There is not much to do on this site, all that is needed is for the session to belong to the admin. We will now go to the second site:

This means that it is possible, through HTTP parameters, to create any values for the session that I want. From the previous challenge I know that the session details are saved on the server in a designated place **but I did not see that there is a separation between domains**. So maybe we can edit the session of the first site using the second site:
