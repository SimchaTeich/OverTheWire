# Level 1 → Level 2

## Level Info
The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text.<br />
Enjoy!

```
ssh krypton1@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231
