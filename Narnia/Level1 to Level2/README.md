#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int (*ret)();

    if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){
        printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
    ret = getenv("EGG");
    ret();

    return 0;
}
```

I already know this form of `int (*ret)();`, it's a **pointer** to function. Because the `getenv` function returns an address (to the contents of `EGG`, actually to some string), we'll want to make `EGG` a type of memory pointer that prints the password.
