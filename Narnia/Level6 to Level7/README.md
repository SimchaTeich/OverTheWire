        /* clear environ */
        for(i=0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
                memset(environ[i], '\0', strlen(environ[i]));
        /* clear argz    */
        for(i=3; argv[i] != NULL; i++)
                memset(argv[i], '\0', strlen(argv[i]));

        strcpy(b2,argv[2]);
        //if(((unsigned long)fp & 0xff000000) == 0xff000000)

`fp` (short for function pointer) is a variable that contains an address to the `puts` function. That means `fp` can be used to access `puts`. Can `fp` be changed? At first glance no, because it seems that it will appear at the top of the stack (and then there is nothing to overwrite despite the use of `strcpy` later)

However, checking the stack after copying the strings `b1` and `b2` (break point after the second `strcpy`)shows an interesting phenomenon, in which the order of the variables is not as I had anticipated:

```
gdb ./narnia6
```
```
b *0x8049sfa
```

x/40wx $sp

* Red - `b2`
* Green - `b1`
* Yellow - `fb`
* Blue - `i`

Is it possible to overwrite `fb` with `b1` to be the `system` function, then overwrite `b1` with `b2` to contain "/bin/sh"?
If so, then we have changed `fb(b1)` from `puts(string)` to `system("/bin/sh")`.

Let's check what the address of the system function is:

```
p system
```
