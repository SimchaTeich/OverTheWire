Let's look at the code:

cat narnia4.c

extern char **environ;

int main(int argc,char **argv){
    int i;
    char buffer[256];

    for(i = 0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
        memset(environ[i], '\0', strlen(environ[i]));

    return 0;
}
```

In challenge `2->3`, after I finished I saw a solution to the challenge in a YouTube video (I attached the link to the video under the title **Appendix**). In the video there was a way to solve the challenge using environment variables. In the current challenge, it seems that the file deletes all environment variables.

But since my solution did not include environment variables - so it also fits here (with necessary changes such as addresses)
